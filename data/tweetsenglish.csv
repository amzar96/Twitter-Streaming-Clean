Unfortunately  we don't really see this effect in #Berlin. Just too many cars  main roads jammed  hence side streets get totally overcrowded with through traffic  too. High traffic density makes it difficult for drivers to properly watch out for children.

Most afternoons  Park Street is jammed & Duke Street is free.The same applies to many streets in PoS.Time to rethink traffic flows; car free is best but stopping street parking & going back to 2 way traffic will help.Parked metal boxes are a terrible waste of road infrastructure.

Thing is  you *can* bike in New York. I did it for years.  I found it safer than Chicago - a terrific bike city  btw - because on most streets the car traffic is so jammed that cars can't move fast enough to hurt you. (Car doors  tho - keep your eyes open.)

Does this mean all the side roads will be jammed AF and the main roads will be clear. Or whats the car limit until it’s an actual traffic jam?

We are terrible in the US on mass transit. The dominance of private cars has led less to freedom of movement than to gridlock  and the typical proposal to build more miles of highways leads to more miles of traffic jammed highways. A second tube there makes much more sense.

Dear @blrcitytraffic traffic on Panathur bridge is always jammed during office hours  although it's a large over bridge   it certainly needs better traffic management as its always scary for all commuters due to cars and bikes coming from all directions.

So  we spent trillions configuring all the streets in LA with lanes just for cars  forcing everyone to buy cars and then be jammed in traffic (but thinking it's progress)? Nuh-uh. Also  yes  terrible parenting to expose children to all that pollution. #FixedItForYou

No  I'm not. If you're an adult and you want to risk your life on the roads  have at it. Should we spend billions we don't have to reconfigure LA roads for a few cyclists? No. Should most people - who get around by car - be traffic jammed for a few cyclists? No. Muting you.
That's so great. I rode a bike on the bike path in Venice for many years. (Been writing bk  not able to leave house for 3 yrs!) I'm all for dedicated bike paths. In sprawling traffic-jammed LA  cutting out car lanes for the few cyclists not ok way to make em.
If you want to understand how inadequate Pakistan’s news industry is  this car caught fire last night while the traffic was jammed. A busy section on motorway. It exploded and people had to be taken to Lahore in ambulances. Yet this is the only news I’ve found on this incident https://twitter.com/sidyousufi/status/947124542123794440 …
This is exactly my view  though I don't have kids. I wish there could be protected bike lanes - & there is one along LA river 1/2 mile from the one that jammed traffic on Venice. LA is just not a city where many can get around by bike  so removing car lane has costs for too many
Muting you  sleazebag. This is a discussion about tradeoffs of removing a lane from Venice Blvd  in sprawling LA  where we get around by cars. This causes jammed traffic & cars speeding through neighborhoods where kids play. You're vile.
When we were kids  my mom alwys took my siblings&I to go out to kl by train cos its much easier (no need to face traffic jammed  no parking). we will park our car at lrt gombak & go there by train.

The other day on jammed M56 saw a BMW driving 20ft behind an ambulance at 70mph! The driver was using the ambulance to beat the traffic. He drove close to prevent other cars from getting in! Absolute idiot. We need more police patrols so there's a deterrent.
The real stupid part was  even using both sides it was *still* traffic jammed. There were just that many cars. Ike flattened Galveston and Houston was crippled for *weeks*.
One thing to add: if traffic on opposing lanes is jammed up  it's much harder to see pedestrians because (e) cars are in the way  (f) their headlights may impact visibility (especially when it's raining). But yeah  if that's the case one needs to slow down and pay more attention.

consider doing same when roads are not closed  but usually jammed with car traffic. You'll find the problem will fix itself without widening roads
Less space for cars leads to congestion  which is fine as motorists are cozy in their boxes. Some (most?) people will opt to take bicycles to get ahead of the jammed car traffic  which calls for better bike infra  which in turn makes cycling more attractive (yay  modal share!)
